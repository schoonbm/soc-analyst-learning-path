# 🛡️ SOC Fundamentals

## 📚 Overview

This section provided a solid introduction to how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) work and what is expected from a SOC Analyst. I learned about SOC structures, analyst tiers, and how alerts are handled from detection to escalation.

## 🎯 Key Concepts I Learned

- **SOC models:** in-house, virtual, co-managed, command
- **Roles within a SOC:** Tier 1/2/3 analyst, incident responder, threat hunter, SOC manager
- SIEM basics and how alerts are generated from log data
- Practical use of EDR, Log Management, and SOAR platforms
- Threat Intelligence feeds and their role in alert investigation
- Common analyst mistakes and how to avoid them

## 🧠 Reflections

Hands-on exposure helped me understand the alert lifecycle — from SIEM detection, to log correlation, to containment using EDR tools. I also learned how critical it is to validate IOC data and think beyond surface-level results from tools like VirusTotal.

## 🛠️ Tools Simulated

- SIEM interface for alert triage
- Log management for tracing malicious activity
- EDR for live analysis and containment
- SOAR for process automation
- Threat Intel feeds like VirusTotal & Talos
